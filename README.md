## Repository Quality

- **Challenges Faced:** One of the most challenging aspects of this project was pushing changes to GitHub, especially after attempting to create feature branches. Overcoming this hurdle involved creating the feature branches from the very beginning and ensuring that changes were pushed regularly as they were made, to ensure everything progressed smoothly.
